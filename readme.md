### Git Assesment


A branch `feature/add_heading` is merged to `develop` branch and you are working on `feature/add_jumbotron` branch since the beginning.
Now you have to rebase your current branch with `feature/add_jumbotron`  with `develop` so that all the updates on the `develop` branch should appear on your branch.

Do the necessary changes on your branch and later merge it to `develop`


At the end develop branch should have all the changes of both branches 
`feature/add_heading` and `feature/add_jumbotron`
